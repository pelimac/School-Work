CISC1610 Computer Science I - Fordham University
Instructor: Tadeusz Strzemecki Time: Fall 2021
General introduction to Computer Science and the fundamental principles of computer programming using the C++ programming language. The course introduces the process of developing algorithms to solve problems and the corresponding process of developing computer programs to express those algorithms.

CISC2000 Computer Science II - Fordham University
Instructor: Dakota Hernandez
Time: Spring 2021
This course is a more advanced course based on CISC1600 introducing C++ language concepts mainly about classes.

CISC2200 Data Structures - Fordham University
Instructor: Michael Kadri
Time: Spring 2023
A survey and analysis of the major types of structure in programs that handle data: arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees and graphs; recursive, iterative, search and sort techniques.  Methods of organizing and manipulating files will be referenced. 


CISC3400 Java Programming - Fordham University
Instructor: Samuel Kamens
Time: Spring 2023
This course covers Java programming and internet computing with various applications.  Topics include: Java programming, object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces (GUI's), applets and applications, multimedia, files and streams, and server communications. 


CISC3500 Database Systems - Fordham University
Instructor: Ying Mao
Time: Summer 2022
This course begins with the introduction of the characteristics of the data base approach and the advantages of using data base systems.  Course topics include the basic concepts and architecture of data base systems, the Relational Data Model concepts, integrity constraints, schemas, views, SQL, data modeling using the Entity-Relationship (ER) model as well as using the Enhanced ER model, UML diagram, practical data base design methodology, normalization process, physical design and system implementation and tuning. Data base security issues were also discussed.

CISC3593 Computer Organization - Fordham University
Instructor: Dakota Hernandez
Time: Fall 2022
This course introduces students to basic concepts in computer organization. It covers binary, octal and hex arithmetic, digital logic, machine and assembly language programming and processor architecture. Students are expected to have had introductory classes in programming and in discrete math. Course assignments will include a focus on both theoretical and practical issues and will include programming assignments.


CISC3593 Operating Systems - Fordham University
Instructor: Samuel Kamens
Time: Spring 2023
This course objective was to develop an understanding of the role of operating systems in the management of the hardware used to process application programs. Problems of resolving deadlock, exclusion, and synchronization, and inter-process communication, queuing, and network control are covered. Topics include: memory management, device management, interrupt systems and systems programming.
